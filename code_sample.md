 üíª AI Code Sample ‚Äì AI-Powered Question Answering for Rural Education

This Python script demonstrates how an AI assistant can answer students‚Äô questions based on local science curriculum. It's designed for mobile or offline-first learning tools in under-resourced areas like rural Tanzania.

It uses Hugging Face's `transformers` library and a pre-trained question-answering model. This is just a simulation ‚Äî in a real deployment, the model could be optimized and translated into Kiswahili.



üß† Objective

To simulate how an AI assistant can:
- Read local curriculum content
- Accept questions from students
- Give accurate, helpful answers in seconds
- Work even on low-end devices (with light models)

 ‚öôÔ∏è Python Code



 This example uses Hugging Face Transformers
to answer questions from rural students.

 Install required library:
pip install transformers

from transformers import pipeline

 Load a Question-Answering pipeline
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

 Example learning content (could be from a textbook)
context = """
The sun is a star at the center of the Solar System. 
It rises in the east and sets in the west. 
It gives off energy in the form of light and heat. 
This energy supports life on Earth and drives the climate.
"""

 Example question from a student
question = "What does the sun provide to the Earth?"

 Feed the question and context into the model
result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)

 Display the answer
print("Question:", question)
print("Answer:", result["answer"])
